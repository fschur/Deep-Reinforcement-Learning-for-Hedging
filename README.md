# Hedging with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning
Implementation of two deep reinforcement learning algorithms from [Hedging using reinforcement learning: Contextual k-Armed Bandit versus Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01623) and [Dynamic Replication and Hedging: A Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Dynamic-Replication-and-Hedging%3A-A-Reinforcement-Kolm-Ritter/4422b5a01f95aacafc443c2612df55cd494fad14).
We will also provide an approach based on classical deep learning, without reinforcement lerning, which performs well.


The code provided is written in Python 3.8, and relies on the following libraries:
* [torch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [machin](https://github.com/iffiX/machin)
* [space-bandits](https://github.com/fellowship/space-bandits)
