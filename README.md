We will also provide an approach based on classical deep learning, wich does not rely on reinforcement lerning.

The code provided is written in Python 3.8, and relies on the following libraries:
* [torch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [machin](https://github.com/iffiX/machin)
* [space-bandits](https://github.com/fellowship/space-bandits)
