# Hedging with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning
Implementation of two deep reinforcement learning algorithms from [Hedging using reinforcement learning: Contextual k-Armed Bandit versus Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01623) and [Dynamic Replication and Hedging: A Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Dynamic-Replication-and-Hedging%3A-A-Reinforcement-Kolm-Ritter/4422b5a01f95aacafc443c2612df55cd494fad14).
We will also provide an approach based on classical deep learning, without reinforcement lerning, which performs well.
